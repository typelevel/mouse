# Mouse
Mouse is a small companion to the [Cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats) functional programming library for Scala. It
includes convenience extension methods for Scala standard library classes, including some found in
[scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) that are not in Cats.

The library arose from this [Cats issue](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues/791) and is a [Typelevel member](http://typelevel.org/projects/).

Mouse 1.x is published for Scala 3.x and is the main branch. Mouse 0.26 is published for Scala 2.12 and 2.13, and will be updated for bugfixes but not new features in future. 

For Scala.jvm:

`"org.typelevel" %% "mouse" % version`

For scala.js 1.x:

`"org.typelevel" %%% "mouse" % version`

## Content

Mouse includes enrichments for:

- [Any](./shared/src/main/scala/mouse/any.scala)
- [F\[A\] for any F, A](./shared/src/main/scala/mouse/anyf.scala)

#### Example:

```scala
scala> import mouse.all._
import mouse.all._

scala> true.option("Its true!")
res0: Option[String] = Some(Its true!)

scala> def makeEven(i: Int) = (i % 2 == 1).applyIf(i)(_ - 1)
def makeEven(i: Int): Int

scala> val e1: Either[String, Int] = Left("failed")
e1: Either[String,Int] = Left(failed)

scala> true.whenA(e1)
res0: Either[String,Unit] = Left(failed)

scala> false.whenA(e1)
res1: Either[String,Unit] = Right(())

scala> res0.cata(msg => s"Message received: ${msg}", "No message")
res1: String = Message received: Its true!

scala> "1.0".parseFloat
res0: Either[NumberFormatException, Float] = Right(1.0F)

scala> "foo".parseIntValidated
res1: cats.data.Validated[NumberFormatException,Int] = Invalid(java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "foo")

scala> val t1 = scala.util.Try(new java.net.URL("https://www.github.com"))
t1: scala.util.Try[java.net.URL] = Success(https://www.github.com)

scala> t1.cata(msg => s"URL is valid!", error => s"URL is invalid: ${error.getMessage}")
res1: String = URL is valid!

scala> t1.toEither
res2: Either[Throwable,java.net.URL] = Right(https://www.github.com)

scala> val t2 = scala.util.Try(new java.net.URL("https//www.github.com"))
t2: scala.util.Try[java.net.URL] = Failure(java.net.MalformedURLException: no protocol: https//www.github.com)

scala> t2.cata(msg => s"URL is valid!", error => s"URL is invalid: ${error.getMessage}")
res3: String = URL is invalid: no protocol: https//www.github.com

scala> t2.toEither
res4: Either[Throwable,java.net.URL] = Left(java.net.MalformedURLException: no protocol: https//www.github.com)

scala> val intToBytes = 123456789.toByteArray
intToBytes: Array[Byte] = Array(7, 91, -51, 21)

scala> val longToBase64 = 123456789L.toBase64
longToBase64: String = AAAAAAdbzRU

scala> 5.squared
res0: Int = 25

scala> 1.5 |> (_.toInt) |> (_.toString)
res0: String = 1

//lift a partial function into a total function to an Either, when you want to treat unhandled input cases as an error
scala> liftEither[Option[Int]]({case Some(n) => n}, a => s"Unexpected: $a")(Some(6))
res0: Either[String,Int] = Right(6)

scala> val mapped = Map(1 -> 2, 3 -> 4).mapKeys(_ * 2)
mapped: Map[Int,Int] = Map(2 -> 2, 6 -> 4)
```

#### Release Notes

Version `1.0.0-M1` (Jan 20)  is a rewrite to Scala 3.x syntax. It is source-compatible with earlier versions but binary-incompatible. Mouse aims to add a minimal feature set over the standard library and Cats; its ideal is to "disappear over time". Accordingly, this version deprecates a number of methods, either because good solutions are available upstream now, or to align names better with emerging standard library conventions.

The 1.x series migrates from Scalatest and Scalacheck to Munit, in pursuit of simplicitly and low maintenance. Note in this release, there's a change to how the library's extensions are made available. The syntax `import mouse.all._` remains, but it is no longer a package object inheriting from a stack of traits. Rather `all` is a package and we use Scala 3's `export` to export extension methods via this package. For users, there should be no change required beyond recompilation.

## Scope of Library

- Provide enrichments to classes from the Scala standard library that convert to Cats datatypes,
or otherwise improve the functional programming experience.

- Make it easier to migrate source code between Scalaz and Cats.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Code contributions should be aligned with the above scope to be included, and include unit tests.

This project supports the [Scala code of conduct](https://www.scala-lang.org/conduct/) and aims that its channels
(mailing list, Gitter, github, etc.) to be welcoming environments for everyone.
